== Introduction

_buddy_ is a complete security library for clojure. With support for:

- authentication, authorization & access rules (ring/compojure extensions)
- secure hash functions (digest)
- password hashing algorithms (bcrypt, pbkdf2, scrypt)
- message/text signing (high level interface)
- signature & authentication (mac & digital signature)
- encryption (block & stream ciphers)
- key derivartion functions (kdf)


== Backward compatibility.

Since version 0.3.0, buddy is splitted in four modules for improve modularity
of the application and allow to people include only wanted parts of buddy
instead of one monolitic library.

Each module has it own functionality and its own documentation. This document/page
only serves as introduction to the library and the content of index.

If you are happy with the monolitic version of buddy, you can emulate them including
all buddy submodules packages like this:

[source,clojure]
----
[buddy/buddy-core "x.y.z"]
[buddy/buddy-sign "x.y.z"]
[buddy/buddy-hashers "x.y.z"]
[buddy/buddy-auth "x.y.z"]
----

See the concrete instalation instructions and version number on specific
module documentation.

An other option is including a meta package (that includes all them in one):

[source, clojure]
----
[buddy "0.4.0"]
----

NOTE: If you are using the *0.2.x* branch, you can see the proper documentation
for that version link:http://funcool.github.io/buddy/0.2.x/[here]
